			<h2> Why We Use the Game </h2>
			<p> This is designed to reinforce the Core Values that Awesome Inc lives by. You should 
				already know them by now: be good, be excellent, be a friend, and be you. You will 
				be trained on these values and encouraged to not only practice them at Awesome Inc, 
				but to adopt them in your own life.

			<h2> What You'll Be Doing </h2>
			<p> You will build a house. To do this, you will have to complete a series of challenges. 
				These tasks include a memory game, a matching game, a snake game, and a minesweeping 
				game. Each task represents a core value, and you will learn more about these values 
				and what it takes to be Awesome!
